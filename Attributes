Fast lib:- it provides cell models and components for high speed of operation 
Library (gpdk045wc):- it specifies the library which is generic physical design kit and using 45nm TSMC version.
Attributes Lists:- To design a full adder circuit , we are giving the  list of attributes. It will operate in volts (1v), current(1mA) and with the time duration of 1ns.
default power supply voltage is 1.32.
leakage power:- unwanted threshold current when the transistor is off.
Area is considered zero when designing the adder circuit.
cell Leakage power is 1.09891.
operating condition is fast.
pins are A,B,CI,Co.
A and B are the input 
CI,Co are of outputs sum and carry.
The function for CO = ((AB)+(BCI)+((CI A)).
The above function performs carry operation.
It provides 7x7 matrix.
This also provides about the cell fall time, cell raise time, power consumption.
It combines the design of flipflops.
Adder considered is 0.
pin S is used for sum function ((A^B)^CI).
delay templates are given as like index1 and index2.
It is given 1 nanowatt to maintain the life span of the battery.
for each function it performs separate operation using basic gates.
